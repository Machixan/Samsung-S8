Samsung Experience Reworked ROM for Galaxy S8 (Exynos) :

This project is a reworked and customized version of a Samsung Experience–based ROM for the Samsung Galaxy S8 (Exynos models). I have taken an existing Samsung Experience ROM as a base and carefully adapted, modified, and refined it to match my own vision of performance, stability, and user experience.

The goal of this project is not just to redistribute a ROM, but to improve, optimize, and modernize the Samsung Experience software while preserving the familiar design and features that make Samsung’s interface unique.

🔧 What This Project Is About :

This ROM started from an existing Samsung Experience base, which I then rebuilt and reconfigured to better suit daily use and long-term stability. My work focuses on:

System optimizations

Performance tuning

Removing unnecessary components

Improving responsiveness

Enhancing the overall smoothness of the user interface

In this build, all Samsung pre-installed applications have been removed and replaced with their Google counterparts to provide a cleaner and more streamlined Android experience.

This means the system uses core Google apps for everyday functionality, reducing system bloat and improving overall performance and storage efficiency.

Additionally, the Google Play Store is already integrated into the ROM, allowing users to download apps immediately after setup without needing to flash additional packages.

This approach ensures a lighter system while keeping full access to the essential Google services and ecosystem.

Rather than changing the identity of Samsung Experience, this project aims to refine it, making it feel lighter, faster, and more efficient while keeping the classic Samsung look and features.

✨ Key Improvements :

Compared to the original base ROM, this version includes:

System-level optimizations for better performance

Reduced background processes for improved battery life

Debloated system for more free storage and smoother operation

Updated system components where possible

Improved touch responsiveness and UI fluidity

General stability improvements for daily use

Various small tweaks and refinements throughout the system

Every change is made with the intention of keeping the ROM stable and reliable while enhancing the user experience.

🎯 Project Philosophy : 

The philosophy behind this ROM is simple:
Keep the Samsung Experience feel, but make it better.

I focus on maintaining compatibility and stability while applying thoughtful improvements that enhance performance and usability without breaking core features.

This is not meant to be an extreme modification or a heavily themed ROM. Instead, it is a refined and optimized Samsung Experience build designed to feel polished and practical for everyday use.

📱 Supported Device :

Samsung Galaxy S8 (Exynos variants)

⚠️ Disclaimer :

This is a custom ROM and is provided as-is. Flashing custom firmware always carries some risk. Make sure to create a full backup before installing.
